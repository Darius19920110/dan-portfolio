<div class='h_text'><strong>Hello! Iâ€™m Daniel Meszaros</strong></div>
<p class="mb-4 about-p"><i>"A family emergency forced me to leave my studies at 20 when I was <strong>studying Computer Science at university."</strong></i></p>

<p class="mb-2 about-p">
The <strong>passion</strong> I had for IT made me want to <strong>study hard</strong> to pursue a career in that field.</p>

<p class="mb-2 about-p">I started self-studying <strong>website development</strong> eight years ago.</br>
Due to the <strong>growing</strong> number of website developers, and the availability of more and more <strong>website creation programs</strong>, I felt that I had to <strong>follow a different path.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-2 about-p">
Instead of studying alone, I wanted to do it differently this time. </br>
To be <strong>successful in</strong> my <strong>IT career</strong>, I knew I needed help.</p>

<p class="mb-2 about-p">
A <strong>cybersecurity</strong> course I took online with <strong>Robust IT</strong> was a great choice for me.</br>
As a result of this time, I began to work with other <strong>programming languages</strong>, such as <strong>Python</strong> and obtained some <strong>certifications.</strong></br>
The field of cybersecurity was not the right fit for me, so I left after a year.</p>

<p class="mb-3 about-p">
In my search for <strong>the best course</strong> to pursue, I decided to go down the <strong>data engineering</strong> route.</br>
Regardless, <strong>I wanted</strong> to pursue a path in which I would be able to use more <strong>programming languages.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-3 about-p">
As part of my quest to <strong>learn data engineering</strong>, I have registered with an <strong>online school</strong> called <strong>AiCore.</strong></br>
Because of a <strong>lack of funds</strong>, I had to <strong>leave</strong> it there, even though I really liked it.</p>

<p class="mb-3 about-p">
As a result of <strong>this period</strong>, I was extremely <strong>disappointed.</strong></br>
The thought of never <strong>succeeding</strong>, of never being able to work in the <strong>IT field</strong>, discouraged me.</br>
However, <strong>I did not give up.</strong></br>
Then I went <strong>one step further.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-3 about-p">
I discovered a great <strong>online school</strong> called <strong>MasterSchool</strong>, and I began <strong>studying data analysis.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-3 about-p">
Due to the fact that the <strong>data engineer</strong> position does <strong>not</strong> fall under the <strong>entry-level</strong> category, I thought this would be a better fit for me.</p>

<p class="mb-3 about-p">
They trained me to <strong>become job-ready</strong> by teaching me <strong>multiple skills</strong> and allowing me to work on a variety of <strong>projects.</strong></br>
The completion of my education has prepared me for a <strong>career in data analysis.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-3 about-p">
Over the past <strong>eight years</strong>, I have gained a significant amount of <strong>experience.</strong></br> 
Moreover, I have <strong>gained knowledge</strong> in the past <strong>eight years</strong> that will benefit me in my future career as a <strong>data analyst.</strong></p>

<p class="mb-3 about-p">
However, this is not the end of my <strong>journey.</strong></br> 
In spite of my interest in many topics related to information technology, I <strong>still self-study hard.</strong></p>
