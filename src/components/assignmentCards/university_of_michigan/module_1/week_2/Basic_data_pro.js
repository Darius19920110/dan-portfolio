                A correlation is a statistical relationship between two
                variables. If we wanted to know if vaccines work, we might look
                at the correlation between the use of the vaccine and whether it
                results in prevention of the infection or disease [1]. In this
                question, you are to see if there is a correlation between
                having had the chicken pox and the number of chickenpox vaccine
                doses given (varicella).
              </p>
              <p className="f-sm">
                Some notes on interpreting the answer. The{" "}
                <strong>had_chickenpox_column</strong> is either{" "}
                <strong>1</strong> (for yes) or <strong>2</strong> (for no), and
                the <strong>num_chickenpox_vaccine_column</strong> is the number
                of doses a child has been given of the varicella vaccine. A
                positive correlation (e.g., <strong>corr &gt; 0</strong>) means
                that an increase in <strong>had_chickenpox_column</strong>{" "}
                (which means more noâ€™s) would also increase the values of
                <strong>num_chickenpox_vaccine_column</strong> (which means more
                doses of vaccine). If there is a negative correlation (e.g.,{" "}
                <strong>corr &lt; 0</strong>), it indicates that having had
                chickenpox is related to an increase in the number of vaccine
                doses.
              </p>
              <p className="f-sm">
                Also, <strong>pval</strong> is the probability that we observe a
                correlation between <strong>had_chickenpox_column</strong> and
                <strong>num_chickenpox_vaccine_column</strong> which is greater
                than or equal to a particular value occurred by chance. A small
                pval means that the observed correlation is highly unlikely to
                occur by chance. In this case, <strong>pval</strong> should be
                very small (will end in <strong>e-18</strong> indicating a very
                small number).

                [1] This isnâ€™t really the full picture, since we are not looking
                at when the dose was given. Itâ€™s possible that children had
                chickenpox and then their parents went to get them the vaccine.
                Does this dataset have the data we would need to investigate the
                timing of the dose?
